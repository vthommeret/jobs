## The Job

* This job is in the engineering group.
* This is an individual contributor role (not people management)
* Located in Los Angeles, although exceptional candidates a few time
  zones away will also be considered.
* Suitable for mid- and senior- level engineers

## Problems

Our UI/UX team is working as a _services group_ to empower feature developers
to make high quality products that our customers will love using.  To do this,
we are treating our react/redux components as _products_ using a full development
lifecycle:  requirements gathers, code standards, documentation, testing and
deployment to production, and then monitoring.  Longer term, we plan on open
sourcing many of these components as well.  In addition to technical problems,
we encounter many lifecycle issues as well:

* Since react is changing rapidly, what defines a good react component?
* React setup is quite complicated. how can you limit (or insulate) the complexity of a react project so it’s easier for newcomers to use.
* How can you monitor your components live in production?
* How do you test functional components?  Visual components?
* What type of static analysis can we do to eliminate errors before production?
  What problems does it catch?  What does it not?
* How do we communicate component changes internally? Externally?

## Solutions

We are actively building out our UI/UX for both midlevel and senior engineers
to help build out our library of components and to improve our react+redux
build system.

While some experience in react+redux is desirable, it need not be from your day job.
Weekend projects count!  Ideally you can point to some existing components on
GitHub, but we understand if that is not possible.  Otherwise:

* Strong javascript skills in a large-scale environment.
* Team-based experience and development will be useful since you’ll be
interacting heavily with designers, the API/Data team and the features teams.
* It’s always good if you have a bit of back-end experience as well.  We use Go
(“[golang]([https://golang.org)”), but happily welcome those with node.js,
python or ruby backgrounds as well.
* Some basics of Linux/Bash will be useful to aid in our component build system.
