# Software Engineering - DevOps - Security

## The Job

* Is in the engineering group
* Located in Los Angeles, CA, although exceptional canidates a few time zones
  away will be considered
* Is an individual contributor job (not people management).
* Note that while is job is focused security, it's really an engineering job
  and likely be 50% programming.

## Problems

Just like everyone else, security vendors have security needs too.  The
tenants of this job are

* Making security visible
* Making security timely
* Making security actionable

Some examples of projects include:

* Is our network topology what we expect it to be.  What tools have your used?
Or have you just written custom scripts?
* In a docker world, how can we make sure the base OS and added components are
up to date?
* Making sure relevant security logs are sent upstream to centralized logging,
and then alerting on anomalies from it.
* Auditing, enhancing, and monitoring our TLS, SSH, Mail and DNS configurations
* Working toward immutable architectures
* Making so no one has a need to log into production sinceâ€¦ everything they need
is outside production already.
* Base OS hardening
* Exporting of security metrics to internal dashboards.

## Solutions

* While knowledge of security is useful, more important is solid software
  engineering skills and having experience in full software lifecycles and
  working in teams.  If
  you wanted to learn more about security this is a great place to start.
* Solid linux and bash experience
* Ideally background with multiple lanaguges either scripting (ruby, python,
  etc) or compiled (java, etc).  Most of our tools are in Go ("golang"), but
  almost nobody on the team had proficiency before joining.
* Integration experience between different systems will be useful.  It's likely you'll be pulling data
  out, asking for data with an API, and pushing to another data store or API.
* Bonus: integration experience with some type of centralized logging (anything from
  syslogd to splunk to sumo logic) and some type of metrics / graphing system
  (anything from graphite to data dog).
