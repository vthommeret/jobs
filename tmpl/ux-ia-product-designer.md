# Product Designer - UX/IA

{{ template "about"  }}

As we grow, we're looking for midlevel and senior product designers who are excited by the challenge of bringing clarity to the complex world of application security and DevOps.

Signal Sciences understands that great technology and user-centered design go hand-in-hand, and values UX as essential to building a great product. We're a highly collaborative and friendly bunch that loves to win as a team. We're ambitious but balanced; we value honesty, humility and mutual respect; and we empower each person on the team to make a meaningful impact and own your projects from start to finish.

We're blazing a trail for how application security should work in an agile/DevOps world, which means you'll get to dig in to in some fun, deeply challenging problems. From building out our design system into living React components to coming up with new visualizations for complex datasets, you'll be working every day to deliver world-class design for some of the biggest and best-known brands on the Internet.

## The Role

Product designers at Signal Sciences work across all [four layers of design](https://blog.intercom.com/the-dribbblisation-of-design/) (outcomes, structure, interaction, visual). You'll get to think strategically about how to make security problems visible and actionable for our customers, while simultaneously working at the atomic level to design interfaces and interactions that add up to a powerful, cohesive and delightful experience. 

While all product designers at Signal Sciences are expected to carry a project from research to polished final product, you will have primary responsibility for defining product flows that map to our users' core tasks, as well as the supporting IA and structure of our application - a meaningful but focused problem space. Questions you'll get get to come in and tackle every day include:

- How do we onboard new users and make the value of the product evident?
- How might our tool help bridge gaps between security teams, DevOps, and software engineering?
- What are the core task flows our product needs to enable, and what structures do we need to design in order to support these journeys?
- How do we use design to transform complex datasets into insights?
- How do we design interactions and flows that allow users to act on insights to protect their applications and respond to attacks?
- How do we define and measure the success of our product as we add features and improve its structure and flow?

## About you

You should have interest and some experience with all the different facets of product design, from UX research and interaction design to visual design and prototyping. However, we are looking for someone who is strong at distilling complexity at the product architecture level - a designer who thinks beyond features and across touch points to create consistent and delightful flows, IA, navigation and structure. The right designer for this role will:

* Be an accomplished UX designer who can solve challenging user experience problems with simple, empathetic solutions. 
* Have experience solving tough interaction problems and thinking through the challenges that come with structuring a large, complex application.  
* Conduct user research to uncover tasks, model information, navigation and flows using UX
* Be a strategic thinker who works hard to correctly frame tough problems, thereby setting teams up to deliver successful solutions. 
* Demonstrate the ability to design polished user interfaces and interactions. While you will often be working to solve high-level problems, you have great taste and a solid understanding of color, typography, motion and visual hierarchy.      
* Use systems thinking to deliver design at scale, rather than creating one-off solutions.
* Have a deep understanding of the materials and constraints of the web. While this role may not contribute production code, you should be familiar with modern front-end engineering tools and practices. 
* Embrace a highly iterative design process. We value teammates who are highly adaptive and great listeners. You must be adept at giving and receiving critiques in a collaborative environment.
