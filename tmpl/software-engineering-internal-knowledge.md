# Software Engineering - Internal Knowledge

{{ template "about" }}

## The Job

* This job is in the engineering group.
* This is an individual contributor role (not people management)
* Located in Los Angeles, although exceptional candidates a few time
  zones away will also be considered.
* Suitable for mid- and senior- level engineers

## Problems

_Make tools that work. Make tools people love. Make the invisible visible._  This
were some of founding principles when starting Signal Sciences. It applies
internally just as much as it does for our main product.  Data is frequently
trapped in inconvenient places and in a poor format.  Getting this data out, to
be people that need it, in a timely manner not only makes their work lives
better -- it accelerates our business.  Unlike product-side engineering with
long leads time, you can build something for your customers and instantly get
feedback from your customers, because your customers are your peers.  This is
incredibly rewarding.   Bonus: you can use the latest browser technology!

## Solutions

Successful candidates are like to be “people oriented” rather than “technology
oriented”.   Former sales engineers:  welcome.   Senior engineers looking for a
more human interaction and perhaps looking to start building a team: welcome.
Product managers and UI people who can code: welcome.   Engineers looking to
learn more about security and business: welcome.

* We'd perfer not using the word “full stack engineer” but you are likely to use a little
bit of database, a little bit of programming, and some UI as well.  So that’s
full stack.
*  We primarily use Go ([golang](https://golang.org/)) but happy to take refugees from
other languages especially Python, Ruby and PHP (others welcome)  Most of the
team did not start on Go, and they have all been productive quickly.
* You’ll need strong linux and some bash skills just to get things moving.
