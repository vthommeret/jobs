# The Job

The Job

* Is in the engineering group.
* Located in Los Angeles, CA, although exceptional canidates a few time zones
  away will be considered.
* Is an individual contributor job (not people management).

# Problems

At Signal Sciences, most of our stack is written in Go (“golang”).  Some
parts are especially performance critical and are looking for a full-time
optimization and code quality maniac. Engineers with C/C++ and Java background
are welcome since the problem space is similar, however you’ll find the tools
in golang to be simpler and easier to use.

* Race detection and concurrency optimization
* Memory allocation and analysis
* Hotspot analysis and remediation
* Improving and adding static analysis tests

But just as important is working on automating these tests so problems are
surfaced faster. 

# Solutions

* Strong linux and bash skills, 
* Written or previously optimized high-load servers (language irrelevant)
* Compiled language background - C/C++ or Java
