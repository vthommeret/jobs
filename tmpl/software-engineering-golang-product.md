# Software Engineering - Golang - Product
{{ template "about"}}
## The Job

* Is in the engineering group.
* Located in either Los Angeles, CA, or New York, NY
  although exceptional canidates a few time zones away will be considered.
* Is an individual contributor job (not people management).

## Problems

We are taking the "greatest hits" of consumer e-commerce and applying to
the enterprise, making tools security and engineering professionals actually want to
use.  This means we are (among other things):

* API first
* Performance obsesed
* Data driven

To this end we have a nice suite of tools to help developers manage complexity
from conception to production: feature flags, one-button deploys, and plenty
of graphs.

We have our own roadmap of features to help change the security, and
web applications are made.  But, in addition, our pesky customers (only the
largest and most sophisticated on Internet) keep finding new uses and keep coming
up with new requirements.

## Solutions

The term "full stack engineer" means something a little different here at
Signal Sciences.  Here it means:

* Working with the Product to help define requirements and scope
* Working with the API team, so you can get you the data you need
* Working with the UI team, so people can actually see your work
* Working with the Support and Sales Engineering Team, to help understand
  customer requirements and any problems with the existing service.
* Working with the Ops to make sure your new servers and services are rock
  solid, monitorable and visibile
* and even talking to customers to get unfiltered feedback.  That's the best part!

And oh yeah, you'll be doing lots of programming.  You'll likely need:

* Strong linux and bash skills
* Proficency in javascript.  We use a lot of
  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)/[Redux](http://redux.js.org) but we'll train you
  for that part.
* Proficeny in a few different lanaguges.  We primarily program in Go
  "[golang](https://golang.org/)" but most of the current team has backgrounds
  in everything from PHP to Java to C++.
* Previous experience in interdisciplinary software development "at scale"
* Background in public facing consumer sites, or enterprise developers
  welcome.
