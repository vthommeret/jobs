# Software Engineering - Golang - Networking
{{ template "about"}}
## The Job

* Is in the engineering group.
* Located in Los Angeles, CA, although exceptional canidates a few time zones
  away will be considered.
* Is an individual contributor job (not people management).
  
## Probems

How fast and efficiently can data be sent between two processes?

Our unique and (patent pending) architecture can scale along with some of the
largest sites on the Internet.  However our customers are always pushing the
boundry (both up in scale, and down to very small machines), and thus so must
we.  To do so we are constantly trying to do more with less, with a balancing
act between CPU, memory and networking.

## Solutions

We have some interesting variations on this, but you’ll likely be well versed
in the following:


* TCP/IP and Unix Domain Sockets
* Connection pooling and multiplexing
* Memory management
* Concurrency primitives and lock-less data structures.
* Data Serialization formats, in particular what are the pros and cons of
  ‘zero-copy’ formats.


While most of the codebase is in [golang](https://golang.org), we are happy to
accept refugees from C/C++ and JVM-based languages.
