## The Job

* Is in the engineering group
* Located in Los Angeles, CA, although exceptional canidates a few time zones
  away will be considered
* Is an individual contributor job (not people management).

## Problems

At Signal Sciences we aim to provide everyone with effective application
security "their way".  We provide many options from reverse proxies to various
language SDKs.  But very often it means plugging into the NGINX server
directly using our module to provide low impact but highly effective application
security.  Due to the nature of NGINX we have to support many different
configurations and versions.  Our customers run some of the highest traffic
sites on the Internet, pushing NGINX to extremes.  This means our module must
also rise to the occasion.

## Solutions

We aim to provide the best out-of-the-box experience for our module with our
NGINX customers.  This means:

* beautiful installation.  The install of the NGINX module is frequently the
  first interaction the customer has with Signal Sciences.  We want love at
  first install.
* high performance, low latency to handle the highest workloads
* highly flexible and configurable to handle unique customer requirements

To do this, you'll need:

* Deep experience understanding, building, configuring and managing NGINX "at
  scale"
* Strong bash and linux skills, along with a solid foundation of TCP/IP and HTTP.
* Strong experience debugging and troubleshooting NGINX performance issues
   and experience in measurement of performance of HTTP web servers.
* C tool-chain experience for building NGINX and all the variations and
  dependencies
* Profiency in at least one other programming language
* [ngx_http_lua_module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) experience a plus!
